# 🚀 Getting Started with Omni AI

Welcome to Omni AI! This guide will help you get up and running in just a few minutes.

## 🎯 What is Omni AI?

Omni AI is an advanced neurosymbolic AI system that combines:
- 🧠 **AI Consciousness** with human-like thinking
- 💾 **Advanced Memory System** that remembers and learns
- 🎬 **Hollywood-Style Interface** for a cinematic experience
- 🔒 **Security Features** to keep everything safe

## ⚡ Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Download Omni AI

```bash
# Copy and paste this into your terminal/command prompt
git clone https://github.com/pratyaypaul6187-art/omni-ai.git
cd omni-ai
```

### Step 2: Set Up Python Environment

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv .venv

# Activate it:
# Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Mac/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Optional: Install GUI support
pip install customtkinter
```

## 🎮 Your First Experience

### Option 1: Launch the Cinematic GUI (Recommended for beginners)

```bash
python launch_gui.py
```

This opens a Hollywood-style interface where you can:
- Chat with the AI using natural language
- See real-time system monitoring
- Experience cinematic visual effects
- Browse the AI's knowledge and memories

### Option 2: Try the Simple Demo

```bash
python simple_nl_demo.py
```

This runs a text-based demo where you can:
- Ask the AI questions
- See how it learns and reasons
- Try different types of queries

## 🗣️ How to Talk to Omni AI

Once you have the system running, here are some things to try:

### 🎨 Creative Questions
- "Write me a short story about robots"
- "Create a poem about artificial intelligence"
- "Imagine what the future looks like"

### 🧮 Logical Questions
- "If all birds can fly and penguins are birds, can penguins fly?"
- "What is 2 + 2?"
- "Explain how computers work"

### 🔬 Analytical Questions
- "What are the pros and cons of renewable energy?"
- "Analyze the impact of social media on society"
- "How does the human brain work?"

### 🪞 Reflective Questions
- "What do you think about consciousness?"
- "How do you process information?"
- "What does it mean to be intelligent?"

## 🎭 Understanding Thinking Modes

Omni AI has different "thinking modes" - like different ways of thinking about problems:

- **🎨 Creative Mode**: For stories, poems, and creative ideas
- **🧮 Logical Mode**: For math, logic puzzles, and facts
- **🔬 Analytical Mode**: For deep analysis and comparisons
- **🪞 Reflective Mode**: For philosophical and self-reflective questions
- **🤝 Collaborative Mode**: For brainstorming and discussion
- **💡 Intuitive Mode**: For quick, gut-feeling responses

The AI automatically picks the best mode, but you can also specify which one to use!

## 💾 How Memory Works

One of Omni AI's coolest features is its memory system. It has different types of memory:

1. **Short-term Memory**: For ongoing conversations
2. **Long-term Memory**: For important information it should remember forever
3. **Episodic Memory**: For remembering events and experiences
4. **Semantic Memory**: For facts and general knowledge
5. **Procedural Memory**: For skills and how-to information

The AI automatically decides what to remember and what to forget, just like humans do!

## 🎬 GUI Features Explained

When you launch the GUI (`python launch_gui.py`), you'll see:

### Main Chat Area
- Type messages to chat with the AI
- See responses with confidence levels
- Watch animated effects as the AI "thinks"

### System Monitor
- See how much memory and processing power is being used
- Monitor the AI's performance in real-time
- Check security status

### Knowledge Browser
- Explore what the AI knows
- See knowledge organized in graphs
- Add new facts for the AI to learn

### Memory Viewer
- Browse through the AI's memories
- See different types of memories
- Search through stored information

## 🔧 Common Issues and Solutions

### "Module not found" errors
```bash
# Make sure you're in the right directory and virtual environment is active
cd omni-ai
.venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### GUI won't start
```bash
# Install GUI dependencies
pip install customtkinter pillow
```

### Slow performance
- Close other programs to free up memory
- Try the text-based demos instead of the GUI
- Restart your computer if it's been running for a while

## 🎯 What to Try Next

Once you're comfortable with the basics:

1. **Explore Different Demos**:
   ```bash
   python demo_integration.py      # Full system demo
   python demo_advanced_reasoning.py  # Advanced reasoning
   python demo_knowledge_manager.py   # Knowledge management
   ```

2. **Learn Programming with Omni AI**:
   - Ask it to explain code concepts
   - Have it write simple programs
   - Use it as a programming tutor

3. **Create Your Own Knowledge Base**:
   - Teach the AI about your interests
   - Build custom knowledge collections
   - Share knowledge between different AI instances

4. **Experiment with Security Features**:
   ```bash
   python demo_security_fortress.py
   ```

## 📚 Learning More

- **README.md**: Complete overview of all features
- **USAGE_GUIDE.md**: Detailed technical examples and tutorials
- **docs/**: Additional documentation and guides
- **GitHub Issues**: Ask questions and report problems

## 🤝 Getting Help

If you get stuck:

1. **Check the error message** - it usually tells you what's wrong
2. **Try restarting** - close everything and start fresh
3. **Check GitHub Issues** - someone might have had the same problem
4. **Ask for help** - create a new issue on GitHub
